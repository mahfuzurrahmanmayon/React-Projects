      question: "Why wouldn't I just hire a full-timer?",
      answer: "Great question! Choosing our subscription model not only provides the expertise of a dedicated Webflow team but also eliminates the need to hire a designer and developer separately. This means you get a comprehensive solution without the long-term commitment and overhead costs associated with traditional hiring. it's a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to meet your design and development needs."

      question: "When can I expect to receive my deliverables?",
      answer: "We work towards finishing tasks within a maximum of 3 days, with potential for earlier completion based on complexity. For projects involving both design and development, the initial design version will be provided within the first 3 days. Upon approval, we'll swiftly move on to the remaining development work, typically completing it within an additional 3 days. Our aim is to deliver efficiently, meeting your unique requirements."

      question: "Is there a limit to the number of requests I can submit?",
      answer: "There's no limit to the number of requests you can submit. While we work on one task at a time, you have the flexibility to manage and prioritize your requests using Notion. Feel free to add as many requests as needed, and we'll ensure each one is handled effectively, maintaining a single active task at a time."

      question: "How soon can I begin using your services?",
      answer: "You can start within few minutes of making your purchase. Upon completing your purchase, we'll send you a Notion invitation for your task requests, along with instructions on how we manage work. If you prefer, we can schedule a call, but you have the option to add and explain tasks directly in the Notion tasks without a meeting. Our goal is to simplify the process for you."

      question: "How does the option to cancel anytime work?",
      answer: "Cancel your subscription anytime, and continue adding requests until the subscription period ends. It's that easy and flexible!"

        question: "What don't you handle in design and development?",
        answer: "While we primarily specialize in website design and Webflow development, there are a few areas we don't cover. This includes logo design, 3D modeling, animated graphics (GIFs, videos, etc.), visual illustrations (although we do cover the visual presentation of web applications), document design, packaging design, and print design. Additionally, we avoid working on projects related to usury, dating, alcohol, and casinos."
